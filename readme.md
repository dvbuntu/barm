# Bayesian Additive Regression Models

This repo is a generalization of [BARN](github.com/dvbuntu/barn), focusing on the mathy research aspects.  There is a sister repo, [`barmpy`](github.com/dvbuntu/barmpy), where I am working on a Python module implementation suitable for use in other research.

One sentence summary: generalize decision trees in BART with any machine learning model that we can explore with MCMC.
